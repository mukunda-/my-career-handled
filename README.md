I started this a few days ago while learning React and brushing up on Node. This is an exercise to help me get in shape with modern web development practices. React is used for all rendering; other technologies present are Jest for testing, with Express+Playwright for end-to-end support; and then there's the slew of other things that create-react-app provides, like Webpack etc.

I wanted to use TypeScript here too, but I had to cut some things out of my curriculum to get this project done in a short timeframe. Setting up my own toolchain was also cut pretty early. I don't like how overbearing create-react-app is, but it allowed for a very quick start.
